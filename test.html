	<h1>Why and How</h1>
	<p>The Lorem ipsum text is typically composed of pseudo-Latin words. It is commonly used as placeholder text to examine or demonstrate the visual effects of various graphic design. Since the text itself is meaningless, the viewers are therefore able to focus on the overall layout without being attracted to the text.</p>
	<p>This page generates a Chinese version of Lorem ipsum text consisting of five paragraphs. Each paragraph consists of 6 to 8 sentences. Each sentence is a pseudo-sentence consisting of very rare characters not recognizable by most readers. The process of generating each pseudo-sentence is described as below.</p>

	<p>First, a real sentence is <a href="#">randomly</a> drawn from a corpus of 128 sentences. Then each Chinese character of the sentence is replaced by a randomly selected, rarely used character (which is practically a pseudo-character because it is not recognizable by most readers) with the same number of strokes. As a result, the visual texture of the pseudo-sentence is very similar to the original real sentence.</p>
